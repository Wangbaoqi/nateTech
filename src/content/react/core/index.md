Consider this math formula: <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 2<MathI>x</MathI></Math>.

If <Math><MathI>x</MathI> = 2</Math> then <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 4</Math>. Always.

If <Math><MathI>x</MathI> = 3</Math> then <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 6</Math>. Always.

If <Math><MathI>x</MathI> = 3</Math>, <MathI>y</MathI> won't sometimes be <Math>9</Math> or <Math>â€“1</Math> or <Math>2.5</Math> depending on the time of day or the state of the stock market.

If <Math><MathI>y</MathI> = 2<MathI>x</MathI></Math> and <Math><MathI>x</MathI> = 3</Math>, <MathI>y</MathI> will _always_ be <Math>6</Math>.


<Recap>

* If two state variables always update together, consider merging them into one.
* Choose your state variables carefully to avoid creating "impossible" states.
* Structure your state in a way that reduces the chances that you'll make a mistake updating it.
* Avoid redundant and duplicate state so that you don't need to keep it in sync.
* Don't put props *into* state unless you specifically want to prevent updates.
* For UI patterns like selection, keep ID or index in state instead of the object itself.
* If updating deeply nested state is complicated, try flattening it.

</Recap>

React will display your <CodeStep step={1}>loading fallback</CodeStep> until all the code and data needed by <CodeStep step={2}>the children</CodeStep> has been loaded.
